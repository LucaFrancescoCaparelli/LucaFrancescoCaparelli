**Hi, I'm Luca Francesco Caparelli 👋🤓  I'm a software developer**

Argentine nationalized Italian. I started working in the IT industry at the age of 18 as a software tester.
  
At the age of 19 I had the opportunity to start making my first steps as a software developer and from that moment HTML, CSS and JavaScript have become my best friends.

Now, at the age of 24, I traveled to Italy to get my Italian citizenship and tour the country where my family's history began.
